1. Class names should always be capitalized
2. Method names should not start with a capital letter
3. Name your methods and variables something that makes sense
4. Indent your code
5. Make sure you limit the scope of your variables-- the variable “a” should be put inside the printNumber method.
6. What is 3.14? It should be a constant named pi.
7. There are absolutely no comments for this class and there should be.
